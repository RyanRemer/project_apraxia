This is a permission called a “HIPAA authorization.” It is required by the “Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996” (known as “HIPAA”) in order for us to get
information related to your health condition to use in this research study.
_____________________________________________________________________________

1. If you sign this HIPAA authorization form, you are giving your permission for the following
people or groups to give the researchers certain information about you (described below):
Any health care providers or health care professionals or health plans that have provided health
services, treatment, or payment for you such as physicians, clinics, hospitals, home health
agencies, diagnostics centers, laboratories, treatment or surgical centers.

2. If you sign this form, this is the health information about you that the people or groups listed
in #1 may give to the researchers to use in this research study:
Diagnoses of any communication disorders

3. The HIPAA protections that apply to your medical records will not apply to your information
when it is in the research study records. Your information in the research study records may also
be shared with, used by or seen by collaborating researchers, the sponsor of the research study,
the sponsor’s representatives, and certain employees of the university or government agencies
(like the FDA) if needed to oversee the research study. HIPAA rules do not usually apply to
those people or groups. If any of these people or groups reviews your research record, they may
also need to review portions of your original medical record relevant to the situation. The
informed consent document describes the procedures in this research study that will be used to
protect your personal information. You can also ask the researchers any questions about what
they will do with your personal information and how they will protect your personal information
in this research study.

4. If this research study creates medical information about you that will go into your medical
record, you may not be able to see the research study information in your medical record until
the entire research study is over.

5. If you want to participate in this research study, you must sign this HIPAA authorization form
to allow the people or groups listed in #1on this form to give access to the information about you
that is listed in #2. If you do not want to sign this HIPAA authorization form, you cannot
participate in this research study. However, not signing the authorization form will not change
your right to treatment, payment, enrollment or eligibility for medical services outside of this
research study.

6. This HIPAA authorization will not stop unless you stop it in writing.

7. You have the right to stop this HIPAA authorization at any time. You must do that in writing.
You may give your written stop of this HIPAA authorization directly to Principal Investigator or
researcher or you may mail it to the department mailing address listed at the top of this form, or
you may give it to one of the researchers in this study and tell the researcher to send it to any
person or group the researcher has given a copy of this HIPAA authorization. Stopping this
HIPAA authorization will not stop information sharing that has already happened.

8. You will be given a copy of this signed HIPAA authorization.
